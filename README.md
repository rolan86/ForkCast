# ForkCast

**Collective intelligence simulation platform. Predict anything.**

Upload documents. Ask a question. AI agents simulate how stakeholders would actually react.

## What It Does

You have a question: *"How will customers react to this pricing change?"* or *"What happens if we publish this policy?"* or *"Which ad copy performs better?"*

ForkCast answers it by simulation, not guesswork.

1. **Upload seed materials** — market reports, policy drafts, competitor analyses, ad copy, anything
2. **Describe your prediction** — natural language, no special syntax
3. **ForkCast builds a knowledge graph** — extracts every entity, relationship, and tension from your documents
4. **AI agents take form** — distinct personas with opinions, biases, and communication styles, built from the actual stakeholders in your data
5. **They simulate social discourse** — posting, commenting, liking, following, muting, arguing across a Twitter/Reddit-like platform for dozens of rounds
6. **You get a prediction report** — written by an AI analyst that interviewed the simulated agents and cross-referenced the knowledge graph

The result: a prediction grounded in collective dynamics, not a single model's best guess.

## Use Cases

**Ad Copy A/B Testing** — Tested two ad directions for a productivity app. 12 agents, 223 actions across 96 rounds. ForkCast correctly identified which copy would generate broader reach and which would trap itself in an echo chamber. [Full case study →](docs/use-cases/ad-copy-ab-testing.md)

**Business Concept Validation** — Will customers, competitors, and regulators actually respond the way your pitch deck assumes? Simulate it.

**Policy Impact Prediction** — Drop a policy draft into ForkCast. Watch how affected communities, advocacy groups, and media react before you publish.

**Crisis Scenario Modeling** — Test your crisis response. See how it plays out in a simulated public forum before it plays out in the real one.

**Narrative Evolution Tracking** — Understand how a story shifts over time as different stakeholders amplify, distort, or redirect it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/merryldmello/forkcast.git
cd forkcast
pip install -e .

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
```

**Option A: Claude API (best quality)**
```bash
# Edit .env → set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
forkcast server start
```

**Option B: Ollama (free, runs locally)**
```bash
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
ollama pull llama3.1    # or qwen2.5:7b, mistral, etc.

# Edit .env:
#   FORKCAST_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
#   FORKCAST_OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1

forkcast server start
```

That's it. One API key — or no API key at all with Ollama. No Zep. No managed graph database. No external services.

### Try Your First Prediction

```bash
# Create a project
forkcast project create \
  --name "My First Prediction" \
  --requirement "How will enterprise CTOs react to a new open source monitoring tool?"

# Upload seed documents
# (via API: POST /api/projects with file uploads)

# Build knowledge graph
forkcast sim create <project-id>
forkcast sim prepare <sim-id>

# Run the simulation
forkcast sim start <sim-id>

# Generate the report
forkcast report generate <sim-id>
```

### Frontend (Optional)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev    # localhost:5173, proxies to API on :5001
```

Vue 3 dashboard with project wizard, D3 knowledge graph visualization, live simulation feed, report viewer, and an Interact tab with 5 modes: agent interview, group panel, survey/poll, agent-to-agent debate, and report chat.

## Why ForkCast?

This project was inspired by [MiroFish](https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish), which proved the concept: swarm intelligence prediction works. 33,000 stars. Brilliant project.

ForkCast takes a different approach:

| | MiroFish | ForkCast |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM** | Qwen (Alibaba) via OpenAI SDK | Claude (Anthropic) + Ollama (local models) |
| **Simulation** | OASIS only | Dual: Claude tool-use + OASIS |
| **Domains** | Hardcoded | File-based plugin system |
| **Evaluation** | None | 16 gates + 7 LLM judgments |
| **Report Agent** | Basic | Tool-use loop with 5 research tools |
| **Agent Chat** | Limited | Full in-character conversations |
| **Interact** | None | 5 modes: interview, panel, survey, debate, report chat |
| **Local Models** | No | Ollama support (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, etc.) |
| **Dependencies** | Zep Cloud + LLM API | One API key — or zero with Ollama |
| **Language** | Chinese-first | English-first |

## Domain Plugin System

ForkCast is designed to predict anything, not just one category. Each prediction vertical is a **domain plugin**: a folder with a manifest and Jinja2 prompt templates.

```
domains/social-media/
├── manifest.yaml          # Name, engine, platforms, prompt paths
├── prompts/
│   ├── ontology.md        # How to extract entities from this domain
│   ├── persona.md         # How to generate realistic agent profiles
│   ├── config_gen.md      # Simulation parameter generation
│   ├── agent_system.md    # Agent behavior during simulation
│   └── report_guidelines.md  # Report structure and analysis style
└── ontology/
    └── hints.yaml         # Seed entity types for the LLM
```

**Shipped domains:** `_default` (generic), `social-media` (Twitter-native personas and social analyst reports)

**Build your own:** `forkcast domain create my-domain` scaffolds the full structure. Customize the prompts. Run a prediction.

## Evaluation Framework

Most AI projects have no way to tell you when their output is garbage. ForkCast does.

**Layer 1 — 16 Programmatic Gates** (fast, free, pass/fail):
Ontology structure, persona count, persona field validation, simulation action counts, report length, report structure, and more. All gates must pass before Layer 2 runs.

**Layer 2 — 7 LLM Quality Judgments** (rubric-based, 1-5 scoring):
Ontology specificity, persona distinctiveness, persona authenticity, simulation in-character behavior, interaction quality, report specialist quality, report evidence grounding.

```bash
# Run evaluation
forkcast eval run <sim-id>

# Compare two runs (before/after prompt tuning)
forkcast eval compare <scorecard-1> <scorecard-2>
```

The eval framework tells you exactly what's weak and how to fix it. Persona distinctiveness score low? The justification text explains why and what to change in the persona prompt.

ForkCast was inspired by [MiroFish](https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish) by Guo Hangjiang. MiroFish proved that swarm intelligence prediction works at scale. ForkCast takes the concept in a different architectural direction.
